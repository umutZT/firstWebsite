            Lock game is a strategy game played with 2 people. The playing field is 4x4-8X8. In the game, both players have 4-8 stones. The object of the game is to reduce the number of opponent's stones below 2.

At the beginning of the game, players place their stones on the squares in the row closest to them. Then the players take turns trying to lock the opponent's stones by moving a stone of their own. The stones can be moved as far as desired horizontally or vertically within the playing field, but the stones cannot be jumped over.

A stone with opponent’s stones on 2 adjacent squares horizontally, a stone with opponent’s stones on 2 adjacent squares vertically, or a stone in the corner with opponent’s stones on the adjacent squares horizontally and vertically is considered locked. If the player whose turn it locks an one or more of his/her opponent’s stones as a result of his/her move, he/she takes that stones out. In other words, a player removes the stone(s) belonging to the opponent player, which he/she locked with his/her own stone while it is his turn to move. The player who succeed to reduce the number of opponent's stones below 2.
